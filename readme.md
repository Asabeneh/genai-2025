## **Module 1: Introduction to Generative AI**

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, learners should be able to:

* Explain what Generative AI is and how it differs from traditional AI.
* Understand how generative models such as GPT and diffusion models work.
* Identify popular Generative AI tools and their use cases.

### 📘 Explanation

Generative Artificial Intelligence refers to a class of AI systems capable of **creating new content**—such as text, code, music, or images—based on what they have learned from vast datasets.

Traditional AI systems *analyze or classify* data (e.g., detecting spam), while Generative AI *produces* new, original outputs (e.g., writing an email or creating a picture).

#### ⚙️ How It Works

Most modern Generative AI tools are built using:

* **Transformers:** The architecture behind models like GPT, Claude, Gemini, and Llama.
* **Diffusion Models:** Used in image generation tools like DALL·E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion.
* **GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks):** One neural network creates data while another evaluates it.

#### 🧠 Real-world Analogy

Think of Generative AI like an *advanced autocomplete system*.
When you start typing, it predicts what you might say next—but it can do this for **entire essays, images, code, or even videos**.

### 🧩 Examples

* ChatGPT writing a professional email.
* DALL·E generating a logo for a business idea.
* Copilot suggesting entire blocks of code.

### 🧪 Exercise

1. In your own words, explain the difference between **traditional AI** and **Generative AI**.
2. Research and list 3 Generative AI tools and describe their main purpose.
3. Use ChatGPT to generate a motivational quote and rewrite it in a funny tone.

### 📝 Quiz

1. What is the main goal of Generative AI?
   a) Classification
   b) Prediction
   c) Creation ✅
   d) Optimization

2. Which of the following models is used for image generation?
   a) Transformer
   b) Diffusion ✅
   c) RNN
   d) CNN

3. True or False: GANs involve two neural networks competing with each other.
